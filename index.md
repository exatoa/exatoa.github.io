# Jaekwon Lee

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Kangwon National University (KNU). Before coming to KNU,
I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/en) (uOttawa) and the University of Luxembourg (UL). I received my PhD at the University of Luxembourg under the supervision of [Prof. Lionel Briand](https://www.lbriand.info/) and in collaboration with [Prof. Shiva Nejati](https://shnejati.bitbucket.io/), and [Dr. Seung Yeob Shin](https://sites.google.com/view/seungyeob/home).
My research interests are in the area of software testing related to mutation testing, automated verification, fault localization, and automatic repair using fuzzing, search-based approaches, and machine learning. I have been conducting my research closely with industry partners in automotive and aerospace sectors, such as [ESA](https://www.esa.int/), [Huld](https://huld.io/industries/space/), [GomSpace](https://gomspace.com/home.aspx), [LuxSpace](https://space-agency.public.lu/en/expertise/space-directory/LuxSpace.html), and [Blackberry](https://www.blackberry.com/).
